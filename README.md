# capacity
This is to be the backend for an application that would count the number of detected people in a livefeed. The idea is to help store owners connect 
with their own CCTV to count the number of people currently in their store and give real-time updates on how close they are to reaching 60% capacity.
This will help store owners ensure proper social distancing during the pandemic. 

The resulting capacity percentage would then be sent to a front end application that employees standing at the doors could use to monitor how many people are 
currently in the store without manually counting the people entering and exiting.
